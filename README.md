Items are grouped by type, and can be further filtered by:
- Name, Level, iLvl, faction, class, source, quality, and binding.
- Weapon types also have a sheath type filter (back, side, hidden)
- One hand weapons can additionally be filtered by hand slot.

**NOTE: Some filters require an item to be cached to function.**
- If an item is not in the itemcache, it will have a red asterisk * next to it's name.

## FAQ

**What items are included?**  
All obtainable items are included and any unobtainable item that was previously available to players.  
f.ex: GM only items are NOT in the database, but Classic Naxxramas, and removed quest rewards are in the database.

**How are item appearences grouped?**   
Items are grouped by their Model, Texture, Geoset, and Visual enchant. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telkar-rg/wow-MogIt-WotLK/main/_IGNORE/img/3.png" align="right" width="25%">   
Some items may appear as duplicate entries, but their DisplayID may have a unique set of data.  Some helms appear the same, but have different options of showing hair or other appearance options.   
f.ex:  Cataclysm helm vs Cataclysm Headguard  

**My server has custom items, how do I add them?**  
You can create a custom module or a new item type under an existing module to store these.  
Another option is an extra module [MogIt-WotLK-Custom](https://github.com/telkar-rg/wow-MogIt-WotLK-Custom), which will load any items added to it to existing modules without needing to edit the base addon. 
Instructions on adding items and further details located there.
